# AI Hub - Multi-Nodal Application for LLM Access
AI Hub is an app i made when i was bored to make it easier to access google's Gemini and openai's GPT. I've included my api keys, but feel free to replace them if mine stop working.

## Instructions:
Download/Clone the repo and run main.py
Add your own API keys in config.py
## Contributions:
Any PRs are appreciated, I'm trying to learn Tkinter and ai as a student so this is a test project for me.
